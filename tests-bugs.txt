Using chrome for testing my code before I implement it into my script file in VScode.

1. It is possible to go through the EAT modal without picking an option and you get an empty result. (ADD - Selected so it never is empty)
2. Suggestions comes up even if they should not be able to do it, meat restaurant should not come up if we choose vegan etc.)
