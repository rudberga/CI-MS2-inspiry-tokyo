<p align="center"><strong>Milestone 2 project - Full Stack Web Developer course - Code Institute</strong></p>

This website is developed for visitors to Tokyo who are not sure of where to go to eat, as Tokyo can easily become ovewhelming. 'Inspiry' wants to be the beacon of light in that sense. The website will act as a travel guide with a minimalistic approach where the tips you receive are directly gathered from local experts. All you have to do is press a few buttons and you will have a suggestion for you, it is that simple!

## UX

### User Stories

See below user stories:

> *- "As a visitor of the website, I expect to be able to easily find the social media pages of the website in the footer, so I can follow them or check company information"*

> *- "As a visitor of the website, I expect to be able to answer questions that work as a filter in the process, in order for the suggestion to fit me"*

> *- "As a visitor of the website, I expect to be able to find a toplist of the most popular locations right now, so that I can get a simple overview"*

> *- "As a visitor of the website, I expect to be able to find a some basic information about Tokyo and the food scene, so that I can get even more excited about using the service"*

### Strategy

The main goal of this project is to develop a user friendly website for people who are traveling to Tokyo and in the need of some inspiration on places to eat. This website will act as a platform they can visit either before traveling to help with the planning or use as a tool while in Tokyo to get some inspiration for the upcoming evening out. The website will have locations which are recommended by local experts, therefore help users to be able to experience the "real" Tokyo.

Project goals: 

- Design a website in a minimalistic, modern and user friendly approach
- Present a smooth experience when choosing the different options which will lead to the final suggestion
- Present valuable suggestions to users, not just picking random places from a guide book
- Present short and inspiring information about Tokyo and the food scene itself

### Scope

The features of this website will let the users:

- Find a location where they can eat easily through a few steps
- Find a location based on their budget and preferences
- Get access to direct links and information about the suggested location before making a decision
- Get an overview of Tokyo and its food scene 
- See a top list with the current top restaurants

### Structure

The design and layout of this website will be intentionally minimalistic and "simple". The reason for this is to stand out from other services such as travel guides which usually overwhelm you with information. The user will basically be able to get a suggestion after a few clicks.

### Skeleton

5 pages included in the wireframe which are:
- Landing page
- Step 1
- Step 2
- Step 3

[Restaurants](assets/docs/restaurants-array.pdf)

I compiled a file with all the restaurants I would pick for my project, in order to get a better overview as well as ticking off all the alternatives. Check the link above.

### Surface

#### Main inspiration
 
My main inspiration for the looks of this website is the architecture of Tokyo during dawn or night. It is very clean, modern and minimalistic.

#### Fonts

I have decided to only use the font **Roboto** in this website, however with different kind of looks. One more playful with a text shadow, and one which is bold and flat for the more stylish element.

![Roboto](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS2-inspiry-tokyo/blob/master/assets/img/roboto-font.png?raw=true "Roboto font")

##### Playful

This is the playful "pop"-version of the font that has text shadow added to it. It makes the website look a little bit more fun when you open it.

![Roboto playful](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS2-inspiry-tokyo/blob/master/assets/img/roboto-playful.png?raw=true "Roboto playful font")

##### Flat

This is the flat version which is extra bold for extra power in the message, which is stylish and minimal for the longer texts and information, also used in the modal for clarity.

![Roboto flat](https://github.com/rudberga/CI-MS2-inspiry-tokyo/blob/master/assets/img/roboto-flat.png?raw=true "Roboto flat font")

#### Colors

The colors of this website is based around the background picture of a Tokyo after dawn as well as the Japanese flag.

I have therefore focused on below colors:

- #e74c3c
- #ffffff
- #4f97c7 
- #000000

| User could pass through the whole modal without choosing a option, which lead them to an empty page for suggestion | Updated code in order to make the next button invalid until an option was chosen | Solved |
| Restaurants from selections which should not show up as a suggestion did so in the end | Created temporary array where restaurants that was selected by the options in modal got pushed into, then in the end a loop to pick a restaurant out of only that array | Solved |
| Modal was not reset when pressing finish button | Adjusted the code so that the arrays was emptied when pressing finish, in that way the user can go through the process again | Solved |
| Space on the right of footer making an unwanted gap | removed right padding of modal button which added a space making width over 100% | Solved |
