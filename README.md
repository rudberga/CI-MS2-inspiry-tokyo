<p align="center"><strong>Milestone 2 project - Full Stack Web Developer course - Code Institute</strong></p>

This website is developed for visitors to Tokyo who are not sure of where to go for food, drinks, party or sightseeing. It will act as a travel guide with a minimalistic approach where the tips you receive are directly from local experts. All you have to do is press a few buttons and you will have a suggestion for you.

### Strategy

The main goal of this project is to develop a user friendly website for people who are traveling to Tokyo and in the need of some inspiration. This website will act as a platform they can visit either before traveling to help with the planning or use as a tool while in Tokyo to get some inspiration for the upcoming evening out. The website will have locations which are recommended only by local experts, therefore help users to be able to experience the "real" Tokyo.

Project goals: 

- Design a website in a minimalistic, modern and user friendly approach
- Present a smooth experience when choosing the different options which will lead to the final suggestion
- Present valuable suggestions to users, not just picking random places from a guide book

### Scope

The features of this website will let the users:

- Find a location where they can eat, drink or party easily through a few steps
- Find a location based on their budget and preferences
- Get access to direct links and information about the suggested location before making a decision

### Structure

The design and layout of this website will be intentionally minimalistic and "simple". The reason for this is to stand out from other services such as travel guides which usually overwhelm you with information. The user will basically be able to get a suggestion after a few clicks.

### Skeleton
